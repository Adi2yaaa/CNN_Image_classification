# CNN_Image_classification

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to create a robust deep learning model capable of recognizing and classifying images into their respective categories with high accuracy.

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where the model assigns a label to an image based on its visual content. CNNs are particularly effective in handling image data due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes.

ðŸ§  Objective
Build an end-to-end image classification model using CNN architecture.

Train and evaluate the model on a labeled dataset of images.

Visualize model performance and evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Understand how convolutional layers extract and learn features from images.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
You can use a standard dataset like:

MNIST: Handwritten digits (0-9)

CIFAR-10: 60,000 32Ã—32 color images in 10 classes (airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.)

Custom Dataset: A local folder structured with subfolders per class.

Each dataset includes:

Training Images: Used to train the model.

Testing Images: Used to evaluate the model's generalization performance.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
Python: Core language used for implementation.

TensorFlow & Keras: Frameworks used to build, train, and evaluate CNN models.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing training curves and confusion matrix.

NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (if needed).

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: For writing and executing code.

Conv2D Layers: Extract features from image pixels.

MaxPooling2D: Reduce spatial dimensions and computation.

Flatten: Converts 2D features into 1D for dense layers.

Dense Layers: Perform classification based on extracted features.

ðŸ“ˆ Model Training & Evaluation
Use categorical crossentropy loss for multi-class classification.

Adam optimizer for efficient training.

Model performance tracked using accuracy.

Visual tools:

Training & Validation accuracy/loss graphs

Confusion Matrix for test predictions

(Optional) Sample predictions on test data

âœ… Output & Results
